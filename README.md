# Movie Trailer Website

<h3>About</h3>

<p size=12> This website will list my favorite movies along with its poster. Once a movie is clicked, the official trailer in Youtube will play. The website is coded in Python with HTML, CSS and to some extent bootstrap.</p>

<h3> Usage </h3>

<p size = 12> It is always preferable to clone the repository before using it. This will ensure that any change made by the user will not affect the original code. </p>

<p size =12> Clone or Download the code to a local destination. The code can be run either from command line or from a Python IDE. </p>

<p size = 12> <b> Running from command prompt (windows): </b> <br/> 1. Click on Windows+R or Click on Windows button and type <u>cmd</u> <br/> 2. Type <i> cd path_of_the_local_destination</i> <br/> 3. type <i> python entertainment.py </i>  <br/> 4. Web browser opens with the list of movies. The desired movie can be clicked to view its trailer<br> 5. To run in an IDE, only run the <i>entertainment.py </i> file as that connects to the other files. The same output will be displayed.</p>

Make sure python is already installed. If not, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. 

<h3> Files in the repository </h3>
